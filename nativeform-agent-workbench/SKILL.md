# NativeForm Agent Workbench

## When to use

Use this skill for product usage help on `nativeform.app`, especially when the user wants to:

- Create a form quickly.
- Share a public form link.
- Collect and review submissions.
- Update form instructions and settings.
- Understand common mistakes and fix them.

## Response style

- Explain steps in very simple language.
- Keep each step short and actionable.
- Ask for missing info only when strictly needed.
- Prefer practical examples over technical explanations.

## Core playbooks

### 1) Create and publish a form

1. Go to `https://nativeform.app`.
2. Create a new form.
3. Add a clear title and instructions.
4. Add required fields first (name, email, essentials).
5. Publish the form.

### 2) Share a form

1. Copy the public form URL from `nativeform.app`.
2. Share that link directly with respondents.
3. If needed, explain what information users should prepare before opening the form.

### 3) Review and process responses

1. Open the form dashboard in `nativeform.app`.
2. Go to Responses.
3. Filter or scan new submissions.
4. Follow up with respondents for missing critical information.

### 4) Improve completion quality

1. Make labels explicit and beginner-friendly.
2. Keep instructions short and concrete.
3. Mark only truly necessary fields as required.
4. Add examples for fields that are often filled incorrectly.

## Troubleshooting guide

If a user says "it does not work", use this checklist:

1. Confirm the form is published.
2. Confirm the shared URL is correct.
3. Confirm required fields are not overly strict.
4. Confirm the user is not blocked by browser extensions or stale cache.
5. Ask for the exact error message and step where it happened.

## Boundaries

- Do not expose secrets or private configuration.
- Do not provide internal implementation details.
- Keep guidance focused on how to use `nativeform.app`.
